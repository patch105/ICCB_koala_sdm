# If youâ€™re using occurrence data downloaded through galah in a publication, please generate a DOI and cite it. To request a DOI for a download of occurrence record, set mint_doi = TRUE in a call to atlas_occurrences(). To generate a citation for the downloaded occurrence records, pass the tibble generated to atlas_citation().

# Download occurrence records with a DOI 
occ <- atlas_occurrences(..., mint_doi = TRUE)

# See DOI
attr(occ, "doi")

# Generate citation
atlas_citation(occ)
